            </div>
            <div><h3>Custom Tactics & Features</h3>
                Those are purely cosmetic and are for informing the players playing your scenario of the changes that you made to the scenario. <br>Usually very helpful to include.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div id='lab_1' class='lab'>
            <div><h3>Starting Reputation</h3>
                Fairly obvious. Is dependent on difficulty level: 
                <ul>
                    <li>+10 rep Casual</li>
                    <li>No change on Normal</li>
                    <li>-7 rep Brutal</li>
                    <li>-10 rep MegaBrutal</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div><h3>Lack of Stability</h3>
                Amount of turns when Lack of Stability starts reducing your reputation.<br>
                Approximately 3 years are used in game (216 turns). 6 turns = 1 month. 72 turns = 1 year.
            </div>
            <div><h3>Corruption</h3>
                This changes when Real Corruption starts hurting reputation. With 1, your reputation with 50% Risk with maxed Corruption, will be treated as if you had 40% Risk. The higher the amount of corruption though, the faster the penalty stacks, so it's not a simple '-10% corruption'.
            </div>
            <div><h3>Insurgent Control</h3>
                This will reduce or increase the amount of reputation lost due to insurgent control. Of course, the higher the amount insurgent controlled zones, the worse for the player a positive modifier of Insurgent Control gets. Sadly, it does not seem that making it strongly negative works as you'd expect it to.
            </div>
            <div><h3>Support Level</h3>
                The amount of Global Support Level you start with. Very slowly applies to zones based on accessibility and distance to HQ, except in zones with Garrisons. Rolling out initiatives speeds it up rather substantially, but not as much as Garrisons. On Megabrutal, halve this value to get an expected amount of local support level.<br>
                Things that use this:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dam Local Employment Program: +4</li>
                    <li>Universal Justice: +3</li>
                    <li>Democratic Transition: +1</li>
                    <li>AntiCorruption: +1</li>
                    <li>Corruption Purge: +1</li>
                    <li>Fuel Hoarding: -3</li>
                    <li>Compulsory Work: -3</li>
                    <li>Tank Justice: -3</li>
                    <li>Civilian Shakedowns: -2</li>
                    <li>Non-essential Spending Freeze: -2</li>
                    <li>Other Specials: -1</li>
                    <li>Coalition Soldier X: -0.1*X</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div><h3>Hostility Level</h3>
                This works similarly to Support Level, albeit applies to turning Hostiles into Neutrals and vice versa. A negative value will decrease hostility (decreasing the amount of hostiles) while a positive hostility will increase the amount of hostiles.<br>
                Things that use this:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dam Local Employment Program: -2</li>
                    <li>Universal Justice: -1,5</li>
                    <li>AntiCorruption: -1</li>
                    <li>Corruption Purge: -1</li>
                    <li>BlackMail Journalists: +4</li>
                    <li>Civilian Shakedowns: +4</li>
                    <li>Fuel Hoarding: +3.9</li>
                    <li>Compulsory Work: +3</li>
                    <li>Tank Justice: +3</li>
                    <li>Other Specials: +1</li>
                    <li>Coalition Soldier 1/2/3/4/5: +0,5/+0,6/+0,9/+1,6/+2,5</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div><h3>Corruption Opinions</h3>
                Multiply how much Corruption affects Support Level. <br>1.1 = 10% more reduction.<br>2 = 100% more reduction.<br> 0.5 = 50% less reduction.<br> 0 = no reduction. <br> -1 = corruption increases support level
            </div>
            <div><h3>Disable Concerns</h3>
                This will stop concerns from growing and appearing.
            </div>
            <div><h3>Additional Concerns</h3>
                On MegaBrutal, the locals might demand a singular upgrade to the road network or up to two security initiatives (triple security concern is extremely rare).<br>
                This will cause them to appear on other difficulty levels (but with pacing and level requirement on the appropriate difficulty)
            </div>
            <div><h3>Local Concerns' Opinions</h3>
                This changes how much Concerns can effect Local Support Level. <br>
                0 = concerns don't affect support level (equivalent to disabling them)<br>
                0.5 = concerns affect support level half as much<br>
                1 = no change<br>
                2 = support level affected twice as much (use with caution on higher difficulty levels - MegaBrutal can grow concerns by 10% a month, especially dangerous with Recruitment Drive)<br>
            </div>
            <div><h3>Starting Funds</h3>
                Self explanatory
            </div>
            <div><h3>Starting Budget</h3>
                The annual budget you get at the beginning of the game.<br>
                Just tinker with it to get the value you want.
            </div>
            <div><h3>Reputation Income</h3>
                This is how much Reputation affects income.<br>
                0 - Reputation doesn't reduce income<br>
                1 - High reputation gives a lot of income<br>
                5 - High reputation gives bazillions of money
                Unless you're making a scenario about keeping your reputation up, I suggest not changing this at all.<br>
                The suggested range is not great though: more than 1 is very likely to give the player a bit too much money.             
            </div>
            <div><h3>Stable Zones Income</h3>
                How much money each Stable Zones give in taxes which go directly to your annual budget. The default value is 1,4.
                <br>Don't set this value too high unless on purpose - otherwise stabilising a couple of zones will make the game significantly easier. Making it close to zero will make keeping reputation up more important.
            </div>
            <div><h3>Inflation Growth</h3>
                How much all inflation growth is multiplied by.<br>
                0.5 - half the inflation you'd expect <br>
                1 - default inflation <br>
                2 - twice the amount of inflation<br>
                To be used with caution.
            </div>
            <div><h3>Funds Excess Limit</h3>
                Once Operation has money over this amount, the money above this amount will start to slowly 'disappear'. The more the money above the specified amount, the faster it disappears. Will never reduce the amount of money below this amount.
            </div>
            <div><h3>Deficit Funding</h3>
                Self explanatory. The more debt is accrued, the higher the reputation loss.
            </div>
            <div><h3>Unreliable Funding</h3>
                The game tends to average the amount of budget received each month but still slightly distributes it. With the 36$ default starting budget you can expect 3$ a month (but will get 2$-4$ usually instead). The higher the value, the bigger the differences between individual numbers may be eg. 25$ once and the rest of the months are 1$ each.
            </div>
            <div><h3>Budget Deadline</h3>
                Self explanatory. 6 turns = 1 month. 72 turns = 1 year.<br>
                Banker Interest, Warlord Blockades and Smuggler Military Inc. unaffected.
            </div>
            <div><h3>Subprime Exposure</h3>
                Self explanatory. 6 turns = 1 month. 72 turns = 1 year.<br>
                Unsure if it affects Banker Interest, Warlord Blockades and Smuggler Military Inc., but highly unlikely.
            </div>
            <div><h3>Disable Peace Negotiations</h3>
                Self explanatory.
            </div>
            <div><h3>Negotiation Effectiveness</h3>
                How fast the negotiations progress. If they progress fast, this may backfire if the insurgents will start reducing negotiation progress.
            </div>
            <div><h3>Stable Zone Negotiation Impact</h3>
                How much stable zones affect the insurgents' willingness to talk. By default you'll need a couple of zones stable to at least start talking to them (after eliminating their presence as well if you don't have enough stable zones)
                0 - no effect<br>
                0.5 - half as much effect<br>
                1 - default<br>
                2 - twice as much effect
            </div>
            <div><h3>Starting Progress</h3>
                Self explanatory.
            </div>
            <div><h3>Disable Corruption</h3>
                Self explanatory.
            </div>
            <div><h3>Starting Corruption Risk</h3>
                Self explanatory. This uses the percentage system
                0 = 0%<br>
                0.5 = 50%<br>
                1 = 100%
            </div>
            <div><h3>Growth</h3>
                How fast corruption matches corruption risk.
                0 - There is no corruption<br>
                0.5 - half the speed<br>
                1 - default speed <br>
                2 - twice as fast<br>
                96 - MegaBrutal speed
            </div>
            <div><h3>Initiative Corruption Risk</h3>
                Self explanatory.<br>
                0 = no corruption risk<br>
                0.5 = half the corruption risk <br>
                1 = value with effective procurement <br>
                1.1 = value without effective procurement<br>
                2 = twice as much corruption risk
            </div>
            <div><h3>AntiCorruption Teams</h3>
                The amount of starting AntiCorruption teams.<br>
                I personally suggest avoiding this setting, instead using a prefunded initiative in order to not confuse the player.
            </div>
            <div><h3>Anti-Corruption Team Effectiveness</h3>
                How fast AntiCorruption teams deal with corruption.
                I personally suggest avoiding this setting, instead using a prefunded initiative in order to not confuse the player.
            </div>
            <div><h3>Charity Corruption Risk</h3>
                Self explanatory.<br>
                If you want to make Charity somewhat more useable, I suggest setting this as low as possible.<br>
                0 - no corruption risk<br>
                0.5 - half as much corruption risk<br>
                1 - default value <br>
                2 - twice as much corruption risk (will make charity very undesirable)
            </div>
            <div><h3>Security Bonus</h3>
                How much Security all zones begin with, on top the starting 10%. This setting uses the percentage system.
                0 = 0%<br>
                0.5 = 50%<br>
                1 = 100%<br>
                Setting this to a negative value seems to do nothing.
            </div>
            <div><h3>Stable Zone Security Modifier</h3>
                How much security % zones gain upon becoming stable.This setting uses the percentage system.
                0 = 0%<br>
                0.5 = 50%<br>
                1 = 100%<br>
            </div>
            <div><h3>Experts Initiative Build Cost</h3>
                Self explanatory.
            </div>

                How fast soldiers become around experts.
                <br>0 - no change
                <br>0.5 - somewhat faster
                <br>1 - all zones around experts become 1 logistic (hot wheels)
            </div>
            <div><h3>Expert Additional Zones Affected</h3>
                Self explanatory. The additional zones do not cost money.

        <div id='lab_2' class='lab'>

                AMOUNT/19*44 , where AMOUNT is the number you put in.<br>
                Thats the base amount of turns that this initiative will roll out.
                Sample values:
                <ul>
                    <li>Education: 4-6</li>

                Not sure even how this works, but setting it too high might cause 
            </div>
            <div><h3>Local Support Level</h3>
                The exact amount of Support Level applied depends on the amount of neutral people in the zone. It starts at 55% of the value on MegaBrutal.<br>
                Some samples:
                <ul>
                    <li>Strong Job: 2.4</li>
                    <li>Mediocre Job: 2</li>
                    <li>Police: 2</li>
                    <li>Weak Job: 1.6</li>
                    <li>District Representatives & Electricity: 1</li>
                    <li>Services: 0.5-0.7</li>
                    <li>Roads: 0.15-0.4</li>

                </ul>
            </div>
            <div><h3>Local Hostility Level</h3>
                See 'Local Support Level' above. Negative values will decrease hostility, whereas positive ones will increase it.<br>
                Additionally, there is an additional hidden variable that is not possible to test, increasing the difficulty of figuring out how it exactly works.<br>
                Some samples:
                <ul>
                    <li>Strong Service -2.4/-2.5/-2.8</li>
                    <li>Mediocre Service: -2.1/-2.24</li>

            <div><h3>Support Level</h3>
                How much Global Support Level is increased when this initiative is completed. Only Telecoms use this - +0.25. For further information, refer to the Support Level part of the 'Civilian Editor'. 
            </div>
            <div><h3>Hostility Level</h3>
                How much Global Hostility Level is increased when this initiative is completed. Only Telecoms use this - -0.25. For further information, refer to the Hostility Level part of the 'Civilian Editor'. 
            </div>
            <div><h3>Local Intel Speed</h3>
                The zone where this initiative is completed, gains this much amount of point of intel gathering. This value also will leak to adjacent zones, increasing intel gathering there as well. District Representatives use this with a value of 0.08.<br>
                The difficulty of intel gathering depends on the hostility in the zone and difficulty level. Decay from insurgent control will slow this significantly, if not completely cancel.
            </div>
            <div><h3>Regional Intel Speed</h3>
                How many points of intel gathering every zone gains when this initiative is completed - it is spread across all zones, therefore it is quite slow. Refer to 'Local Intel Speed' for extra information.
            </div>
            <div><h3>Rollout Time Bonus</h3>
                How much faster initiatives are rolled out in zones where this initiative is completed. Uses a percentage system.
                -0.25 - 25% slower rollout
                0 - no change
                0.5 - 50% faster rollout
            </div>
            <div><h3>Upgrade Roads</h3>
                How much the road network is upgraded when the initiative is completed. Warning: Dirt Roads of level 3 are broken (OP) and roads of level -1 are a pain.
                <br>To be used with caution.
            </div>
            <div><h3>Security Level</h3>
                How much Security % is added to the zone.<br>
                -0.2 - -20%, to a minimum of 1%, when completed<br>
                0 - no change <br>
                0.4 - +40% security when completed<br>
                Militia is 0.4<br>
                Police 1 is 0.9<br>
                Police 2 is 2<br>
            </div>
            <div><h3>Kill Insurgents</h3>
                Self explanatory. Default security initiatives have this set to 1.
            </div>
            <div><h3>Destruction Chance</h3>
                Kind of misleading. When insurgents decide what to destroy, they put together the weight of all initiatives and randomly choose one. The ones weighting more, are more likely to be destroyed. IF redoing all initiatives, feel free to set this to any amount.<br>
                Default values are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Militia: 0.2</li>
                    <li>Police: 0.15</li>
                    <li>District Representatives: 0.1</li>
                    <li>Jobs: 0.05</li>
                    <li>Infra: 0.025</li>
                    <li>Services/Road 1: 0.005</li>
                    <li>School Expansion/Vaccination Drives: 0</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div><h3>Rollout Focus</h3>
                Lie. This is the maximum distance an initiative can be rolled out from the government. There is no 'chance'. Setting this to insanely high amounts will not stop initiatives from rolling out in HQ.
            </div>
            <div><h3>Rollout Amount</h3>
                Self explanatory. If this runs out, initiative will stop rolling out.
